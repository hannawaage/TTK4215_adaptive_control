# Assignments in the course TTK4215 Adaptive Control

The assignments are all simulations in matlab to understand different aspects of adaptive control.

From the course description:

# Course content
The course gives and introduction to methods for adaptation and learning in control of dynamic systems with uncertain parameters. On-line parameter estimation: On-line parameter estimation: gradient methods and least squares methods in continuous and discrete time. Parameter estimation with projection. Extremum seeking methods. Direct and indirect adaptive control: pole placement control (PPC), adaptive pole placement control (APPC), model reference control (MRC), model reference adaptive control (MRAC), adaptive backstepping with tuning functions. Machine learning methods: neuroadaptive control and reinforcement learning control.
